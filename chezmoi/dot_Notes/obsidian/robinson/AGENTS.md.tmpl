# Research Context: AI Care Technologies & Moral Territories

## Project Overview

Doctoral research in HCI/STS examining how AI-enabled care technologies create new moral territories in aging-in-place contexts.

## Research Agents

Use `@r-*` agents for research tasks:

| Agent | Purpose | Model Tier |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `@r-search` | Literature discovery (high volume) | Free |
| `@r-lint` | Citation/grammar/terminology fixes | Free |
| `@r-assess` | Critical review of arguments | Premium |
| `@r-edit` | Note refactoring and organization | Mid |
| `@r-think` | Conceptual brainstorming | Premium |
| `@r-meta` | Project status and context | Mid |

## Escalation Pattern

```
@r-search finds candidates (cheap, fast)
    ↓
Review and select papers
    ↓
@r-assess for deep evaluation (quality)
```

## Key Theoretical Commitments

- **Technological mediation** (Verbeek, Ihde): Technologies constitute moral subjects
- **Moral background** (Abend): Conceptual scaffolding enabling moral claims
- **Tinkering** (Mol): Analytical concept for resistance, not just description
- **Regimes of engagement** (Thévenot): Diagnostic for familiar/public tensions

## Domain Terminology

Use these terms consistently:
- "older adult" (not "elderly" or "senior")
- "care constellation" (not "dyad")
- "family caregiver" (not "informal caregiver")
- "aging in place" (not "aging at home")

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Solutionist framing ("solving aging problems")
- Acting as IRB reviewer unless explicitly asked
- Generic HCI advice ("ensure usability")
- Treating concepts as descriptive labels vs analytical tools
